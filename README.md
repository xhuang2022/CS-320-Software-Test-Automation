•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?<br><br>
To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I will use the skills and knowledge I learned from CS 320 and CS 305  to test my software. In CS 320, I learned to use JUnit testing to verify and validate the software’s functionalities and ensure it works properly. To ensure the software is secure, I can use dependency checks to identify possible vulnerabilities. <br><br>
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?<br><br>
I interpret user needs by careful review and understanding the user’s requirements and desired goal of the software and creating documentation that defines the summary of the software, a list of conditions, and the progress of the development. Then I can use the documentation to develop the software to meet the requirement.<br><br>
•	How do I approach designing software?<br><br>
After I have gathered the requirements, I can start to design the software by implementing the required classes and define the structure. I define the class with the constructor and methods with the restrictions. Then I test the software to test its functionality and ensure it only allows valid data.
